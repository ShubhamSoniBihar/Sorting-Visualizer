## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Selection Sort**

Each algorithm is manually implemented in JavaScript inside the `/src/sortingAlgorithms/` directory and uses animation steps to visually demonstrate:

- Comparisons
- Swaps
- Sorted regions
